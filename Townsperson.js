                "Darren:\n\n Native plants have formed symbiotic relationships with\n native wildlife over thousands of years, and therefore\n offer the most sustainable habitat.\n A plant is considered native if it has occurred naturally in a\n particular region, ecosystem, or habitat without human introduction.",
                "Darrne:\n\n Exotic plants that evolved in other parts of the world\n or were cultivated by humans into forms that donâ€™t exist\n in nature do not support wildlife as well as native plants.\n Occasionally, they can even escape into the wild and become invasive\n exotics that destroy natural habitat.",
                "Darren:\n\n Native plants help the environment the most when planted\n in places that match their growing requirements.\n They will thrive in the soils, moisture and weather of\n your region. That means less supplemental watering, which can\n be wasteful, and pest problems that require toxic chemicals.\n Native plants also assist in managing rain water runoff and\n maintain healthy soil as their root systems are deep and\n keep soil from being compacted."
