                "Native plants help the environment the most when planted in places that match their growing requirements.\n They will thrive in the soils, moisture and weather of your region.\n That means less supplemental watering, which can be wasteful, and pest problems that require toxic chemicals.\n Native plants also assist in managing rain water runoff and maintain healthy soil as their root systems are deep and keep soil from being compacted."
